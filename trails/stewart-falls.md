There a trickier section near the trailhead that may prove slightly difficult for children, old timers, and new hikers, but the majority of the trail is flat and well-kept.

#### Location
About a thirty minute drive from our house. Head toward Sundance on I-92 and continue north until you find the National Parks booth. The parking lot, trail head, and bathrooms are to the left directly after the booth.

#### Fee
$6 (in cash) is required for the National Parks pass. The pass is good for three days and expires at noon on the third day.

### Notes
We have yet to make it to the actual falls. We turned back early our first time because of impending bad weather.
